Project Description: Job Completion Options.
This project is inspired by the classic "cheap, fast, good" dilemma often encountered in job completion scenarios. In this project, we explore the constraints and possibilities of these options / choices.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to implement a system that allows users to choose between three options: "cheap", "fast", and "good". However, there are specific constraints imposed on these choices;
-Cheap and Fast: Users can choose to have the job completed quickly and at a low cost, but the quality might not be optimal.
-Good but Not Cheap: Users can prioritize quality, ensuring that the job is done well, but this might come at a higher cost and not necessarily completed quickly.
-Good and Cheap but Not Fast: Users can opt for both quality and affordability, but the job may not be completed quickly.

Implementation:
The project will involve creating a user interface where users can toggle between these options and observe the constraints enforced by the system. The interface will visually indicate the selected options and provide feedback on the chosen combination.

Technologies Used:
-React: The project was built using React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
-React Icons (BiToggleLeft, BiToggleRight): Icons was used to represent the toggle options for a better user experience.
-CSS: Styling was applied using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the user interface.

Usage:
-Users can navigate to the application and observe the available options: "cheap", "fast", and "good".
-Clicking on each option will toggle its state, indicating whether it is selected or not.
-Users will observe how the system enforces the constraints based on their selected combination of options.
